			<h4>HT LetterSpacer is a tool for spacing fonts, that works on finished fonts as well as during development. The first public version works as a macro for <a href="https://glyphsapp.com">Glyphs</a> and uses that application's glyph categories and subcategories feature, but the method is adaptable to any editor or programming language.</h4>

			<p>With HT LetterSpacer making a consistent spacing is easy, because you can define fixed parameters of spacing during your type design process and focus on the letterform drawing. </p>
			<p>By making the spacing of a font simpler you can try different spacing options quickly without going mad. </p>
			<p>Today HT LetterSpacer doesn't kern, it is only for setting glyph widths and sidebearings.</p>

						<p>No. You have to configure and use it in what you think is the best way. You still need to know what you are doing. The default configuration will output a reasonable result for a beginner, but it does not replace the eye of a master type designer. To achieve an excellent spacing you need to make an excellent configuration and use of the script. But having good results will be easier and faster.</p>

					<div class="accordion-content" data-tab-content>
						<p>HT LetterSpacer is a method for define sidebearings based on the amount of white space or area in a glyph box, and define a way to measure it, using 3 parameters for each master. The parameters are set up for lowercase letters and modified by a configuration template to different groups of letters (using the glyph categories in Glyphs.) There is a script version with a window, where you can apply specific parameters to selected glyphs. The area entered, the zone measured and the depth from each glyph sides will be equalized for all the glyphs in a group.</p>
						<p>You can use the script based on a template where each category of glyphs has a number that changes the area parameter proportionally, to do a general spacing that looks good. Otherwise you can work applying specific parameters manually to different groups of glyphs, on the fly. The more you put your eye and hand on the process, the more accurate are the results. HT LetterSpacer allows you to work on groups of glyphs reducing the time and effort for achieve a consistent spacing. </p>
						<p>It works with big families and many masters. If you've changed your mind late in the process, or you want to adapt your fonts to a new purpose, then redesigning the spacing scheme of the entire typeface family is easy. The results can be mixed with your type designer eye as much as you wish.</p>
						<p>With HT LetterSpacer it is possible to work on tabular or fixed width glyph groups (like tabular numbers) too, on a case by case basis. For monospaced fonts you can set the script to a global tabular mode. </p>
						<p>HT LetterSpacer is a tool for type designers. There are no magic parameters and each designer can make their own experiments to achieve different results and find their own way to use it for different purposes. Spacing a font is a matter of design, where the designer must make many decisions based on the proportions of letters, the general look, the role of tabular glyphs, and many other factors. </p>

					<div class="accordion-content" data-tab-content>
						<p>Andrés Torresi is the initial and primary author of this tool. Soon after joining the postgraduate course in typeface design in Buenos Aires in 2009 he began research to find a simple and semi-automated method to set glyph sidebearings, that could work at any moment during a project, and that the type designer can control. Today HT LetterSpacer is the result of this research, and has been thoroughly tested by Andrés and Juan Pablo del Peral at the Huerta Tipográfica foundry and other designers on Latin, Greek, Cyrillic, and Devanagari designs. Experiments with Latin fonts by several other type designers around the world were conducted during development, and each said that the HT LetterSpacer program produces great results.</p>
						<p>At the ATypI 2015 in São Paulo, Andrés approached Dave Crossland to discuss ways of funding the project to make it available under the GPLv3 license. Andrés wanted to invite other type designers and software developers to use, study, share, and improve the tool, because with peer review it can grow beyond what he can do by himself and become a basis for better and new approaches to font spacing. The tool was used and tested privately by the Google Fonts team and finally at ATypI 2016 in Warsaw Andrés and Georg Seifert announced that HT LetterSpacer is finally available for all Glyphs users from the Glyphs Plugin System with sources at <a href="https://github.com/huertatipografica/HTLetterspacer">https://github.com/huertatipografica/HTLetterspacer</a></p>
