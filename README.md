# Huerta Tipogr√°fica Letterspacer

HT Letterspacer is a tool for spacing fonts, that works on finished fonts as well as during development.
The first public version works as a macro for [Glyphs](https://glyphsapp.com) and uses that application's glyph categories and subcategories feature, but the method is adaptable to any editor or programming language.
